# MekBay

A web-based application for managing BattleTech forces with interactive record sheets that can be used online or printed.

**🌐 Latest stable build:** [https://mekbay.com](https://mekbay.com)

**🌐 Latest experimental build:** [https://next.mekbay.com](https://next.mekbay.com) (can break anytime! use at your own risk!)

## Overview

MekBay is an Angular-based application designed for BattleTech enthusiasts to:

- **Manage BattleTech Forces**: Organize and track your mechs, vehicles, and other units
- **Interactive Record Sheets**: Use digital record sheets during gameplay with real-time damage tracking and status updates
- **Print Support**: Generate printable versions of record sheets for tabletop play
- **Force Organization**: Build and maintain multiple force compositions, save/load/share them across devices with cloud sync

Follow the steps below to set up your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Version 24 LTS or higher is required. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: This is usually installed automatically with Node.js.
- **Angular CLI**: Version 21+, while not strictly required to run scripts (as we use local binaries), installing it globally is helpful for generating components.
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MegaMek/mekbay.git
   cd mekbay
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   This command downloads all necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Dependencies

The application depends on the `mm-data` repository for the `prerun` task (see [`Development`](#development) section below). Clone it as a sibling to the `mekbay` folder.
```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/MegaMek/mm-data.git
cd mekbay
```
*Note: You can configure a custom path to `mm-data` by creating a `.env` file in the project root and setting the `MM_DATA_PATH` variable (for example: `MM_DATA_PATH=../../mm-data`).*

### Development

To start a local development server, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Assets**:
   Before running the app for the first time, you must generate compressed assets and metadata (required only once).
   ```bash
   npm run prerun
   ```
   *Note: The `mm-data` repository is required for generating compressed assets. Without it, the application will still run, but unit icons and other resources will be missing.*

2. **Start the Server**:
   Launch the development server. This watches for file changes and rebuilds the app in memory.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
